Welcome to my Portfolio!
========================
My name is Jared Gurr, and I've been building apps and programs for the past 2 years. 
I have been mostly self taught aside from some mentorship I received from a relative who is a DevOps engineer. 

Through his advice and based on the path I'm pursuing, I have built a skillset in these technologies in the hopes of becoming a DBA or a Java Backend Web Developer with MySQL:
- Linux/Ubuntu (Workstation OS)
- BASH (Bourne-Again Shell, Scripts & system administration)
- VIM (editor)
- Docker (containerizer)
- Git (version-control)
- Eclipse (Java IDE)
- HTML5/CSS3 (front-end web)
- JavaScript/JQuery (front-end web scripting)
- NodeJS (server Environment & MySQL connector)
- MySQL/MariaDB (Server Database)
- Java (Backend web)
- Vertx (Asynchronous Java API)
- Couchbase/N1QL (Alternative NoSQL Database)

Projects:
---------
### \#1 lawnWebpage
My first project was a Webpage just to see if I could successfully connect users to a MySQL database.
I had a little fun with it, and made it into a real looking webpage for a lawncare business.
It's viewable at the LawnWebpage link.

Technologies used: Docker, Git, HTML/CSS/JS, NodeJS, & MariaDB.

### \#2 arizonaPomeranians
This next project was just another website, but this one was more of a favor where I updated a old website for some relatives.
It's viewable at arizonapomeranians.com

Technologies used: HTML/CSS/JS

### \#3 DungeonCrawlDepths
After that, my next major project is one that is still being worked on to this day, but it's made enough progress where we actually have something functional.
It's quite a large project with 3 total contributors. The idea was from the person who mentored me, he always wanted to make an improved version of
this game on the internet called 'Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup'. Basically it's a free 2d game with characters moving around on tiles, you start in a cave at level 1 
with the goal of reaching the bottom and retrieving a 'orb' and then exiting the cave. Along the way there are many various monsters, shops, loot, and even ghosts of 
past players that will try and stop you. If you die, you start over from the beginning, and games can generally last from 10-100 hours. It is surprisingly deep.
Anyway, our project is inspired by that game. We built our version from the ground up and had to implement some advanced libraries in Java to make the entire game 
work Asynchronously with our server receiving and sending data about the players and their game.
There is a whole lot more details about this in this link if you're interested in checking out more of what the development entailed.
The actual github page for it is here: 

Technologies used: Docker, Git, Eclipse, Vert.x, Java, Reactor Core 3, Couchbase/N1QL, HTML/CSS/JS

### \#4 GoogleDocs
This project was a effort with one of my brothers to make a app similar to Google Docs, in order to prove our skill with backend web development, 
specifically in regards to connecting MySQL server and querying the database, and saving and loading users pages exactly as they left it.
