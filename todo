1: Now that base webpage is set up, I need to finish building the foundation of media queries or flexbox or grid to make it responsive in the way I want. (See my css page for details about which way is best.)
2: After that add a header and footer and asides that are interesting or lead to some cool links of places and philosophies I like about programming. Such as Open GNU License, Linux, etc... Or maybe links to some of my other sites like on social media, my linkedIn, email address, pdf resume etc...
3: Try to think of some things I can use JavaScript and Java for in my project. Obviously Java can be used to route to the website and any other pages. At this point, I can't think of any for JS. JavaScript may not be able to be used at all really.
