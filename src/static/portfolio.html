<h3>Here is a list of my projects with many more on the way:</h3>
<li><a href="http://lawnarizonablog.com">http://lawnarizonablog.com</a></li>
<p>This was my very first project I ever did. Built with Node.js and Mariadb connector. </p>
<p>Goal was to develop skill with Database Integration to web apps.</p>
<li><a href="http://arizonapomeranians.com">http://arizonapomeranians.com</a></li>
<p>This was my second project, client had an old webpage they wanted me to replace with a more modern one.
    but still keep the appealing parts of it.</p>
<p>Here I got to practice my skill with JS-DOM manipulation for the pictures.</p>
<li>CrawlWebpage:</li>
<p>This is currently my most ambitious project. It is still a work in progress and it's a group effort
    of me and two other developers.</p>
<p>It's basically a video game you play in your browser based on the online game "Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup".</p>
<p>The reason I liked working on this project so much is it deepened my understanding of Java programming
    on the backend with JavaScript on the front end, and use of Model-View-Controller concepts as well as
    reactive programming with Vertx, Web Routing and finally I learned standard practices that businesses
    such as American Express use for Couchbase and N1QL on this project.</p>
