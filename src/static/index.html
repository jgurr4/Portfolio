<h1>Hi, my name is Jared Gurr. Thank you for taking a look at my portfolio!</h1>

<h4>I am working currently as a backend web developer. I have made several websites and apps which are
    meant to be professional looking or just show my skill with database connectors for database technologies such as
    Mariadb/MySQL and Couchbase. </h4>
<h4>Based on the path I'm pursuing, I have built a skill-set in these technologies:</h4>
<li>Linux/Ubuntu/Alpine/RancherOS (My workstation OS is Pop!_OS)</li>
<li>BASH (Bourn-Again Shell, used for Scripts and System Administration)</li>
<li>VIM (My Text-Editor of choice.)</li>
<li>Docker/Docker-compose (Containerization tech)</li>
<li>Git (For version-control of my projects)</li>
<li>Intellij IDEA (My preferred Java IDE)</li>
<li>HTML5/CSS3 (For front-end web)</li>
<li>JavaScript/JQuery (For front-end web scripting/DOM manipulation)</li>
<li>NodeJs (Server Environment & Mariadb connector)</li>
<li>MySQL/MariaDB (Server Database)</li>
<li>Java (My Preferred Backend Web Language)</li>
<li>Vertx (Asynchronous Java API)</li>
<li>Reactor Core & rxJava2 (Reactive API's for Java)</li>
<li>Couchbase/N1QL (A no-sql server database alternative to Mariadb)</li>

<h3>Qualifications:</h3>
<li>2 years of experience developing web applications.</li>
<li>Mostly self-taught aside from some mentorship.</li>
<li>1 year of college</li>
<li>Deep understanding of computers and hardware. Built several powerful pc's from scratch for people.</li>
<li>Java Certified from Oracle</li>
<li>Eagerness and willing to learn new things. Continuous education is my goal.</li>

<h3>Here is a list of my projects with many more on the way:</h3>
<li><a href="http://lawnarizonablog.com">http://lawnarizonablog.com</a></li>
<p>This was my very first project I ever did. Built with Node.js and Mariadb connector. </p>
<p>Goal was to develop skill with Database Integration to web apps.</p>
<li><a href="http://arizonapomeranians.com">http://arizonapomeranians.com</a></li>
<p>This was my second project, client had an old webpage they wanted me to replace with a more modern one.
    but still keep the appealing parts of it.</p>
<p>Here I got to practice my skill with JS-DOM manipulation for the pictures.</p>
<li>CrawlWebpage:</li>
<p>This is currently my most ambitious project. It is still a work in progress and it's a group effort
    of me and two other developers.</p>
<p>It's basically a video game you play in your browser based on the online game "Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup".</p>
<p>The reason I liked working on this project so much is it deepened my understanding of Java programming
    on the backend with JavaScript on the front end, and use of Model-View-Controller concepts as well as
    reactive programming with Vertx, Web Routing and finally I learned standard practices that businesses
    such as American Express use for Couchbase and N1QL on this project.</p>
