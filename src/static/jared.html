        Bourne-Again Shell</a> is a shell with powerful scripting capabilities and regex
        searches. I use it for administration, automating scripts for MySQL/Couchbase queries, deploying Docker
        containers, and Github push/pull updates.</p>
    <p id="couchbased" class="hideDesc"><a href="https://docs.couchbase.com/home/server.html" target="_blank"

        Couchbase</a> is a NoSQL database which uses json Documents to store data.
        It uses it's own language called N1QL (pronounced Nickel). I use it as an alternative to MySQL/MariaDB
        for projects that may benefit from it's powerful features and simplicity.</p>

                                        title="Click to see official site.">
        Docker</a> is a "Containerization" software which allows you to develop and
        deploy apps inside totally controlled environments. All my apps run inside Docker containers so that
        no matter what server my apps are running on, it will work the same no matter what base OS or hardware that
        server uses.</p>
    <p id="gitd" class="hideDesc"><a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank" title="Click to see official site.">
        Git</a> is a minimalistic and lightweight but powerful version control software
        which makes it easy to develop projects/apps and explore ideas in separate "branches", and if some new feature
        breaks the program I can always rewind back to a previous state when it worked. It's also great for
        team-driven development.</p>

        front-end
        of my web applications, I am not an expert with them like I am with the other Backend technologies, but I
        know enough so that I could make my projects look good enough to post on the web.</p>

        IntelliJ IDEA</a> is my preferred Java IDE. I used to use Eclipse, but found
        that IntelliJ was more intuitive and required much less configuration than Eclipse did. Thanks to
        IntelliJ Ultimate my productivity has definitely increased substantially, but don't expect me to have
        any numbers to substantiate that claim. Suffice it to say, it at least feels like I am getting more done
        with it than I was with other IDE's.</p>

        Java</a> as the main backend language of all my web applications. This is
        because Java as an Application language has much more power and features than something like JavaScript/Node.js.
        This is the reason I devoted more time to learning and mastering Java than I did to JavaScript. Combined
        with Vert.x for asynchronicity, Java is a ideal programming language for handling all my web applications
        backend code.</p>
    <p id="jsd" class="hideDesc"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript" target="_blank"
                                    title="Click to see official site.">
        JavaScript</a> is the first programming language I learned, and it's what I
        use to manipulate the HTML DOM for apps that require it, and to communicate to Java Backend programs.</p>
    <p id="linuxd" class="hideDesc">After I built my own PC, I decided to install both Windows and <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux" target="_blank" title="Click to see official site.">
        Linux</a> on it
        in a dual boot configuration. Within a short time, I found out I liked developing within Linux much more than
        I did within Windows, so now I mostly use Linux for 100% of my programming. Right now my workstation OS
        is Pop!_OS, which is based on Ubuntu. Beyond that, I also run my servers in RancherOS and use Alpine
        within that.</p>

                                       title="Click to see official site.">
        MySQL/MariaDB</a> are databases I learned as my primary method of storing data
        from my websites. This is my second most studied programming language behind Java as it is the one I use the
        most.</p>
    <p id="noded" class="hideDesc"><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/about/" target="_blank"
                                      title="Click to see official site.">
        Node.Js</a> is the program I learned to use simply because before I knew Java/Vertx
        it was an effective and easy way to connect MySQL to my websites. NPM and Node.Js are technologies I am
        very familiar with, and can use effectively.</p>
    <p id="rxjavad" class="hideDesc"><a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava" target="_blank"
                                        title="Click to see official site.">
        RXJava2</a> was the reactive Extensions package I learned for use with Vertx,
        and since Couchbase uses only Reactor Core I also learned that. I learned them so that I could make my Java
        code reactive. So I am very familiar with Reactive code and it's syntax.</p>
    <p id="vertxd" class="hideDesc"><a href="https://vertx.io/" target="_blank" title="Click to see official site.">
        Vert.x</a> is the technology that makes all my Java Code Asynchronous and
        it makes communication between backend and frontend code, as well as communication between Java classes very
        simple/intuitive with it's eventBus messaging system. Beyond that, when it is combined with couchbase database
        it is a great
        recipe for handling communication between servers and clients even if there are millions of people logging
        in at the same time. Vert.x also has tons of helpful documentation. In my opinion Routing webpages also seems
        easier in
        Vert.x. All of these reasons leads me to using Vert.x for all my Java webapps.</p>
    <p id="vimd" class="hideDesc"><a href="https://www.vim.org/" target="_blank" title="Click to see official site.">
        VIM</a>(Vi-Improved) is one of my all time favorite technologies I learned in the past
        few years. It is simply an editor, but it is so powerful and has so many capabilities, that any code
        or even simple text documents you write will be done in much less time than it takes in normal text
        editors. Check out the webpage and you'll see more details explaining vim. All my programs are written in VIM.</p>

    <p>This was my very first project I ever did. Built with Node.js and Mariadb connector. </p>
    <p>Goal was to develop skill with Database Integration to web apps.</p>
    <li><a href="http://arizonapomeranians.com">http://arizonapomeranians.com</a></li>
    <p>This was my second project, client had an old webpage they wanted me to replace with a more modern one.
        but still keep the appealing parts of it.</p>
    <p>Here I got to practice my skill with JS-DOM manipulation for the pictures.</p>
    <li>CrawlWebpage:</li>
    <p>This is currently my most ambitious project. It is still a work in progress and it's a group effort
        of me and two other developers.</p>
    <p>It's basically a video game you play in your browser based on the online game "Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup".</p>
    <p>The reason I liked working on this project so much is it deepened my understanding of Java programming
        on the backend with JavaScript on the front end, and use of Model-View-Controller concepts as well as
        reactive programming with Vertx, Web Routing and finally I learned standard practices that businesses
        such as American Express use for Couchbase and N1QL on this project.</p>
